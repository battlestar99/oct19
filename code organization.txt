Why Maven: 

1. java project is just a folder - it is not importable 
2. version of libraries - 2.53, 3.3 - one version of all the libraries are required 
dependence managment - libraries 
gettext
3. building code means - compiling code 
4. sharing our code - CI/CD - jenkins - build managment system 

Maven setup - 

1. project from scratch - you need to create a maven project 
2. already have maven project - you need to download it from the repository 
and just start using it 

local - in our local computer 
remote - maven repository online
